Description: A toolbox for constructing potential landscapes for dynamical systems using Monte Carlo simulation. 
    The method is based on the potential landscape definition by Wang et al. (2008) <doi:10.1073/pnas.0800579105> 
    (also see Zhou & Li, 2016 <doi:10.1063/1.4943096> for further mathematical discussions) and can be used for 
    a large variety of models.
